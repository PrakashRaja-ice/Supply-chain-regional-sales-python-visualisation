# Supply-chain-regional-sales-python-visualisation

## Supply chain analytics is a valuable part of data-driven decision-making in various industries such as manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and logistics. It is the process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting data related to the movement of products and services from suppliers to customers.

**The dataframe includes columns like ‘OrderNum’, ‘Sales Channel’, ‘WarehouseCode’, and dates related to purchases, shipping, and delivery. The code snippet shows operations to calculate delivery time and convert currency strings to numeric values in the ‘UnitPrice’ and ‘UnitCost’ columns. This is typically done using the pandas library in Python, which is great for data manipulation and analysis.**

Regional sales analysis,” which compares the sales counts across four different channels.

In-Store Sales: The highest sales are from in-store purchases, totaling 3298.0.
Online Sales: The second-highest sales come from online transactions, amounting to 2425.0.
Distributor Sales: Sales through distributors are the third-highest, with a count of 1375.0.
Wholesale Sales: The lowest sales are from wholesale, with a count of 893.0.
This analysis visually emphasizes that in-store sales dominate in this particular region, followed by online, distributor, and wholesale channels.

The code is set up to create a pie chart and a bar plot, both titled “Profit for Different Sales Channels.” The pie chart will display the percentage of total profit for each sales channel, while the bar plot will show the total profit by sales channel. This kind of visualization is useful for quickly understanding which sales channels are most profitable. 

Wholesale: Accounts for 29.4% of the total profit.
Online: Represents the largest share with 41.2% of the profit.
Distributor: Contributes 18.0% to the overall profit.
In-Store: Makes up 11.4% of the profit.
This visual representation helps in understanding which sales channels are most profitable and can guide business decisions

Number of Orders Fulfilled from Different Warehouse.” It compares the count of orders fulfilled by six different warehouses. The warehouse coded as WARE-PJU100 has the highest number of fulfilled orders, exceeding 2000. This chart is useful for analyzing the distribution workload and performance of each warehouse.


Different sales channels, represented as a percentage of the total profit. Here’s the breakdown:

WARE-MKL1006: 14.9% of the total profit.
WARE-XYSl001: 10.7% of the profit.
WARE-NBVl002: 8.4% of the profit.
WARE-NMKl003: The largest share with 31.7% of the profit.
WARE-UHYl004: 16.2% of the profit.
WARE-PJUl005: 18.1% of the profit.
This visualization helps in understanding the contribution of each sales channel to the overall profit. 

Different sales channels across various warehouses. Here’s a summary:

Sales Channels: Distributor, In-Store, Online, Wholesale.
Warehouse Codes: WARE-MKIL006, WARE-NBV1002, WARE-NMK1003, WARE-PJL0105, WARE-PUJ1004, WARE-RYU1004, WARE-XYS1001.
Profit Range: Up to 1 million (indicated by 1e6 on the y-axis).
Visualization: Each warehouse has four bars showing profits from each sales channel.
This chart is useful for analyzing which sales channels and warehouses are most profitable.


“Monthly Profits” shows the profit growth from January 2018 to December 2021. The profits fluctuate over time, with some periods showing an increase and others a decrease. This visual data can be crucial for financial analysis or business planning, as it highlights trends and patterns in profitability over the four-year span.

 “Profit generated based on Delivery Time” shows that as the delivery time increases to around 20, the profit generated peaks and then declines sharply. This suggests there might be an optimal delivery time for maximizing profit. The graph spans a delivery time range from 0 to 35 and profit range up to 1 million. It’s a useful visualization for analyzing the impact of delivery efficiency on profitability.

  “Profit generated by each Sales Team” shows the profits made by 28 different sales teams, with amounts ranging up to 1.6 million. Each team’s profit is represented by a bar, color-coded from dark blue to yellow. The graph includes error bars, indicating variability in the data. This visualization can help compare team performance and guide business decisions.

Profit generated by each Sales Team” shows the profits made by 28 different sales teams, with amounts ranging up to 1.6 million. Each team’s profit is represented by a bar, color-coded from dark blue to yellow. The graph includes error bars, indicating variability in the data. This visualization can help compare team performance and guide business decisions.

Delivery time vs Profit with Order Quantity as size” shows individual sales data points, where the size of each point reflects the order quantity. The graph indicates no significant trend between delivery time and profit, as shown by the red trendline. This analysis can help understand the relationship between delivery efficiency, profit, and order quantity in sales.

Learning Curve for LGBMRegressor” shows the model’s performance as it learns from the training data. Here are the key points:

Training Score: Remains stable across the number of training examples.
Cross-validation Score: Increases and begins to plateau, indicating improving model performance with more data.
R Squared Value: Ranges from 0.94 to 1.00, showing high model accuracy.
Training Examples: Ranges from 1000 to 6000, providing a broad dataset for model training.
This graph is useful for evaluating the model’s learning progress and ensuring it is neither overfitting nor underfitting.

Residual Plot for LGBMRegressor” shows the residuals, which are the differences between the actual values and the predicted values by the model. The plot indicates that there is no significant trend in the residuals, as they are scattered around the zero line. This suggests that the LGBMRegressor model is performing consistently across the range of actual values. Residual plots like this are useful for diagnosing the fit of a regression model.
